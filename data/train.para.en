whereas :
( 3 ) these assessment reports have been reviewed by the member states and the commission within the standing committee on the food chain and animal health .
( 4 ) in accordance with article 6 ( 4 ) of directive 91 / 414 / eec and in view of a possible unfavourable decision for 2,4-db and for pendimethalin the commission organised tripartite meetings with the main data submitter and the rapporteur member state on 7 may 1998 and on 4 june 1999 . for both substances the main data submitter provided further data in order to meet the initial concerns .

the commission of the european communities ,
having regard to the treaty establishing the european community ,
having regard to council directive 91 / 414 / eec of 15 july 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market ( 1 ) , as last amended by commission directive 2003 / 39 / ec ( 2 ) , and in particular article 6 ( 1 ) thereof ,
whereas :
( 2 ) france received an application under article 6 ( 2 ) of directive 91 / 414 / eec on 14 february 1996 from fmc europe nv ( now fmc chemical sprl ) concerning carfentrazone-ethyl . this application was declared complete by commission decision 97 / 362 / ec ( 4 ) .
( 3 ) the united kingdom received an application under article 6 ( 2 ) of directive 91 / 414 / eec on 23 april 1998 from zeneca agrochemicals uk ( now syngenta ) concerning mesotrione . this application was declared complete by commission decision 1999 / 392 / ec ( 5 ) .
( 4 ) france received an application under article 6 ( 2 ) of directive 91 / 414 / eec on 15 september 1999 from rhone poulenc agri sa ( now bayer cropscience ) concerning fenamidone . this application was declared complete by commission decision 2000 / 251 / ec ( 6 ) .
( 5 ) the netherlands received an application under article 6 ( 2 ) of directive 91 / 414 / eec on 6 march 1996 rhône-poulenc agro ( now bayer cropscience ) concerning isoxaflutole . this application was declared complete by commission decision 96 / 524 / ec ( 7 ) .
( 7 ) the draft assessment reports have been reviewed by the member states and the commission within the standing committee on the food chain and animal health . the review was finalised on 15 april 2003 in the format of the commission review reports for mesotrione , trifloxystrobin , carfentrazone-ethyl , fenamidone and isoxaflutole .
( 8 ) the review of trifloxystrobin and fenamidone did not reveal any open questions or concerns , which would have required a consultation of the scientific committee for plants .
in a second consultation on the same substances the scientific committee was asked to comment on the appropriate degradation kinetics to be assumed in model calculations of the leaching behaviour . the committee found certain parameters used in the modelling were insufficiently justified and the half life time of degradation for the rpa 203328 metabolite may have been under-estimated ( 11 ) .
the model calculations of the leaching behaviour of isoxaflutole and its degradation products were subsequently revised along the lines suggested by the scientific committee .
( 13 ) after inclusion , member states should be allowed a reasonable period to implement the provisions of directive 91 / 414 / eec as regards plant protection products containing trifloxystrobin , carfentrazone-ethyl , mesotrione , fenamidone and isoxaflutole and in particular to review existing provisional authorisations and , by the end of this period at the latest , to transform those authorisations into full authorisations , to amend them or to withdraw them in accordance with the provisions of directive 91 / 414 / eec .
( 14 ) it is therefore appropriate to amend directive 91 / 414 / eec accordingly .
( 15 ) the measures provided for in this directive are in accordance with the opinion of the standing committee on the food chain and animal health ,
has adopted this directive :
article 1
annex i to directive 91 / 414 / eec is amended as set out in the annex to this directive .

directive 2003 / 53 / ec of the european parliament and of the council of 18 june 2003 amending for the 26th time council directive 76 / 769 / eec relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations ( nonylphenol , nonylphenol ethoxylate and cement ) ( text with eea relevance )
directive 2003 / 53 / ec of the european parliament and of the council
of 18 june 2003
amending for the 26th time council directive 76 / 769 / eec relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations ( nonylphenol , nonylphenol ethoxylate and cement )
( text with eea relevance )
the european parliament and the council of the european union ,
having regard to the treaty establishing the european community , and in particular article 95 thereof ,
having regard to the proposal from the commission ( 1 ) ,
having regard to the opinion of the european economic and social committee ( 2 ) ,
acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in article 251 of the treaty ( 3 ) ,
whereas :
( 1 ) the risks posed to the environment by nonylphenol ( np ) and nonylphenol ethoxylate ( npe ) have been assessed in accordance with council regulation ( eec ) no 793 / 93 of 23 march 1993 on the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances ( 4 ) . the assessment identified a need to reduce those risks and , in its opinion of 6 and 7 march 2001 , the scientific committee on toxicity , ecotoxicity and the environment ( cstee ) confirmed that conclusion .
( 2 ) np is classified as a " priority hazardous substance " in directive 2000 / 60 / ec of the european parliament and of the council of 23 october 2000 establishing a framework for community action in the field of water policy ( 5 ) . pursuant to article 16 ( 6 ) of that directive , the commission is to submit proposals of control for the cessation or phasing-out of discharges , emissions and losses of such substances .
( 3 ) commission recommendation 2001 / 838 / ec of 7 november 2001 on the results of the risk evaluation and the risk reduction strategies for the substances : acrylaldehyde ; dimethyl sulphate ; nonylphenol phenol , 4-nonyl- , branched ; tert-butyl methyl ether ( 6 ) , adopted within the framework of regulation ( eec ) no 793 / 93 , proposed a risk limitation strategy for np and npe , recommending in particular that restrictions be placed on their marketing and use .
( 4 ) in order to protect the environment the commission is invited to consider an amendment to council directive 86 / 278 / eec of 12 june 1986 on the protection of the environment , and in particular of the soil , when sewage sludge is used in agriculture ( 7 ) , with a view to establishing a concentration limit value for np and npe in sewage sludge that is to be spread on land .
( 5 ) in order further to protect the environment , the placing on the market and the use of np and npe should be restricted for specific uses which result in discharges , emissions or losses to the environment . however , the restriction concerning co-formulants in pesticides and biocides should be without prejudice to the validity of existing national authorisations of pesticides or biocidal products containing npe as a co-formulant , which have been granted before the entry into force of this directive , until they expire .
( 6 ) scientific studies have also shown that cement preparations containing chromium vi may cause allergic reactions in certain circumstances , if there is direct and prolonged contact with the human skin . all uses of cement bear the risk of direct and prolonged contact with the human skin , with the exception of controlled closed and totally automated processes .
( 7 ) the cstee has confirmed the adverse health effects of chromium vi in cement .
( 10 ) in order further to protect human health , the commission is invited to consider an amendment to annex i to directive 98 / 24 / ec so as to establish a binding occupational exposure limit value for dust .
( 12 ) council directive 76 / 769 / eec of 27 july 1976 on the approximation of the laws , regulations and administrative provisions of the member states relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations ( 11 ) should be amended accordingly .
( 13 ) the objective of this directive is to introduce harmonised provisions with regard to np , npe and cement , thus preserving the internal market whilst ensuring a high level of protection for health and the environment , as required by article 95 of the treaty .
( 14 ) the adoption of a harmonised testing method is desirable for the application of this directive as regards the content of chromium vi in cement but should not delay the entry into force of this directive . therefore , the commission , in accordance with article 2a of directive 76 / 769 / eec , should establish such a method . the testing method should preferably be developed at european level , if appropriate by the european committee for standardisation ( cen ) .
have adopted this directive :
article 1
1 . annex i to directive 76 / 769 / eec is hereby amended as set out in the annex to this directive .
2 . the validity of existing national authorisations of pesticides or biocidal products containing npe as a co-formulant , which have been granted before the entry into force of this directive , shall not be affected by this directive until they expire .
article 2
a harmonised testing method for the application of point 47 , cement , of annex i to directive 76 / 769 / eec shall be adopted by the commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in article 2a of that directive .
article 3
before 17 july 2004 member states shall adopt and publish the provisions necessary to comply with this directive . they shall forthwith inform the commission thereof .
they shall apply these provisions from 17 january 2005 .
where these provisions are adopted by member states , they shall contain a reference to this directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication . the methods of making such reference shall be laid down by the member states .
article 4
this directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the official journal of the european union .

commission directive 2003 / 63 / ec of 25 june 2003 amending directive 2001 / 83 / ec of the european parliament and of the council on the community code relating to medicinal products for human use ( text with eea relevance )
commission directive 2003 / 63 / ec
of 25 june 2003
amending directive 2001 / 83 / ec of the european parliament and of the council on the community code relating to medicinal products for human use
( text with eea relevance )
the commission of the european communities ,
having regard to the treaty establishing the european community ,
having regard to directive 2001 / 83 / ec of the european parliament and of the council of 6 november 2001 on the community code relating medicinal products for human use ( 1 ) , as last amended by directive 2002 / 98 / ec ( 2 ) , and in particular article 120 thereof ,
whereas :
( 1 ) every medicinal product for human use that is to be placed on the european community market must be granted a marketing authorisation delivered by a competent authority . with the view to obtaining a marketing authorisation , an application dossier containing particulars and documents relating to the results of tests and trials carried out on this medicinal product must be submitted .
( 2 ) the detailed scientific and technical requirements of annex i to directive 2001 / 83 / ec need to be adapted to take account of scientific and technical progress and in particular of a large set of new requirements resulting from recent legislation . the presentation and content of the marketing authorisation application dossier have to be improved in order to facilitate the assessment and the better use of certain parts of the dossier which are common to several medicinal products .
( 3 ) within the framework of the international conference on harmonisation ( ich ) a consensus was reached in 2000 to provide a harmonised format and terminology for a common technical document through which a homogeneous organisation and presentation of a marketing authorisation application dossier for human medicinal products could be achieved . standardised marketing authorisation dossier requirements should therefore be introduced in order to implement the common technical document without delay .
( 4 ) the standardised marketing authorisation dossier requirements ( harmonised format ) should be applicable to any type of medicinal product for human use , regardless of the procedure for the granting of the marketing authorisation . some medicinal products present , however , such specific features that all the requirements cannot be fulfilled . to take account of these particular situations , a simplified dossier presentation should be provided for .
( 7 ) the vamf system should consist of a two-step assessment : first , an assessment of the vamf carried out at community level , the result of which , i.e. a certificate of compliance with the community legislation for each vamf , must be taken into account by any national competent authority , preventing them from any subsequent reassessment ; second , an assessment of the finished medicinal product ( combined vaccine ) containing the modified antigen which is the task of the competent authority that granted the combined vaccine marketing authorisation .
( 8 ) herbal medicinal products differ substantially from conventional medicinal products in so far as they are intrinsically associated with the very particular notion of herbal substances and herbal preparations . it is therefore appropriate to determine specific requirements in respect of these products with regard to the standardised marketing authorisation requirements .
( 9 ) the treatment of various acquired and inherited pathological dysfunctions in humans calls upon novel concept-based approaches based on the development of biotechnology techniques . the latter involve the use of advanced therapy medicinal products based on processes focused on various gene-transfer-produced bio-molecules ( gene therapy medicinal products ) and manipulated or processed cells ( cell therapy medicinal products ) as active substances .
( 10 ) in so far as they achieve their essential action through metabolic , physiological and immunological means to restore , correct or modify physiological functions in humans , these novel complex therapeutic products representing a new category of biological medicinal products in the sense of articles 1 and 2 of directive 2001 / 83 / ec . the general principles already applicable to these products should be specified from a scientific and technical point of view and the specific requirements with regard to the standardised marketing authorisation requirements should be determined .
( 11 ) directive 2001 / 83 / ec should be amended accordingly .
( 12 ) the measures provided for in this directive are in accordance with the opinion of the standing committee for medicinal products for human use ,
has adopted this directive :
article 1
directive 2001 / 83 / ec is amended as follows :
a ) in the second paragraph of article 22 the words " part 4 ( g ) " are replaced by the following : " part ii , point 6 " ;
b ) annex i is replaced by the text in the annex to this directive .
article 2
member states shall bring into force the laws , regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this directive by 31 october 2003 at the latest . they shall forthwith inform the commission thereof .
when member states adopt those provisions , they shall contain a reference to this directive or be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication . member states shall determine how such reference is to be made .
this directive is applicable as from 1 july 2003 .
article 3
this directive shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the official journal of the european union .
article 4
this directive is addressed to the member states .

4.2 . content : basic principles and requirements
special attention shall be paid to the following selected elements .
( 1 ) the pharmacological and toxicological tests must show :
a ) the potential toxicity of the product and any dangerous or undesirable toxic effects that may occur under the proposed conditions of use in human beings ; these should be evaluated in relation to the pathological condition concerned ;
b ) the pharmacological properties of the product , in both qualitative and quantitative relationship to the proposed use in human beings . all results must be reliable and of general applicability . whenever appropriate , mathematical and statistical procedures shall be used in designing the experimental methods and in evaluating the results .
additionally , it is necessary for clinicians to be given information about the therapeutic and toxicological potential of the product .
( 2 ) for biological medicinal products such as immunological medicinal products and medicinal products derived from human blood or plasma , the requirements of this module may have to be adapted for individual products ; therefore the testing program carried out shall be justified by the applicant .
in establishing the testing program , the following shall be taken into consideration :
all tests requiring repeated administration of the product shall be designed to take account of the possible induction of , and interference by , antibodies ;
examination of reproductive function , of embryo / foetal and peri-natal toxicity , of mutagenic potential and of carcinogenic potential shall be considered . where constituents other than the active substance ( s ) are incriminated , validation of their removal may replace the study .
( 3 ) the toxicology and pharmaco-kinetics of an excipient used for the first time in the pharmaceutical field shall be investigated .
( 4 ) where there is a possibility of significant degradation during storage of the medicinal product , the toxicology of degradation products must be considered .
4.2.1 . pharmacology
pharmacology study shall follow two distinct lines of approach .
- firstly , the actions relating to the proposed therapeutic use shall be adequately investigated and described . where possible , recognised and validated assays , both in vivo and in vitro , shall be used . novel experimental techniques must be described in such detail as to allow them to be reproduced . the results shall be expressed in quantitative terms using , for example , dose-effect curves , time-effect curves , etc . wherever possible , comparisons shall be made with data relating to a substance or substances with a similar therapeutic action .
- secondly , the applicant shall investigate the potential undesirable pharmaco-dynamic effects of the substance on physiological functions . these investigations shall be performed at exposures in the anticipated therapeutic range and above . the experimental techniques , unless they are standard procedures , must be described in such detail as to allow them to be reproduced , and the investigator must establish their validity . any suspected modification of responses resulting from repeated administration of the substance shall be investigated .
for the pharmaco-dynamic medicinal product interaction , tests on combinations of active substances may be prompted either by pharmacological premises or by indications of therapeutic effect . in the first case , the pharmaco-dynamic study shall demonstrate those interactions , which might make the combination of value in therapeutic use . in the second case , where scientific justification for the combination is sought through therapeutic experimentation , the investigation shall determine whether the effects expected from the combination can be demonstrated in animals , and the importance of any collateral effects shall at least be investigated .
4.2.2 . pharmaco-kinetics
pharmaco-kinetics means the study of the fate of the active substance , and its metabolites , within the organism , and covers the study of the absorption , distribution , metabolism ( bio-transformation ) and excretion of these substances .
the study of these different phases may be carried mainly by means of physical , chemical or possibly by biological methods , and by observation of the actual pharmaco-dynamic activity of the substance itself .
information on distribution and elimination shall be necessary in all cases where such data are indispensable to determine the dosage for humans , and in respect of chemo-therapeutic substances ( antibiotics , etc . ) and substances whose use depends on their non-pharmaco-dynamic effects ( e.g. numerous diagnostic agents , etc . ) .
in vitro studies also can be carried out with the advantage of using human material for comparison with animal material ( i.e. protein binding , metabolism , drug-drug interaction ) .
pharmaco-kinetic investigation of all pharmacologically active substances is necessary . in the case of new combinations of known substances , which have been investigated in accordance with the provisions of this directive , pharmaco-kinetic studies may not be required , if the toxicity tests and therapeutic experimentation justify their omission .
the pharmaco-kinetic program shall be design to allow comparison and extrapolation between animal and human .
4.2.3 . toxicology
a ) single-dose toxicity
a single-dose toxicity test shall mean a qualitative and quantitative study of the toxic reactions , which may result from a single administration of the active substance or substances contained in the medicinal product , in the proportions and physico-chemical state in which they are present in the actual product .
the single-dose toxicity test must be carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines published by the agency .
b ) repeat-dose toxicity
repeated dose toxicity tests are intended to reveal any physiological and / or anatomo-pathological changes induced by repeated administration of the active substance or combination of active substances under examination , and to determine how these changes are related to dosage .
generally , it is desirable that two tests be performed : one short term , lasting two to four weeks , the other long-term . the duration of the latter shall depend on the conditions of clinical use . its purpose is to describe potential adverse effects to which attention should be paid in clinical studies . the duration is defined in the relevant guidelines published by the agency .
c ) geno-toxicity
the purposes of the study of mutagenic and clastogenic potential is to reveal the changes which a substance may cause in the genetic material of individuals or cells . mutagenic substances may present a hazard to health since exposure to a mutagen carries the risk of inducing germ-line mutation , with the possibility of inherited disorders , and the risk of somatic mutations including those leading to cancer . these studies are obligatory for any new substance .
d ) carcino-genicity
tests to reveal carcinogenic effects shall normally be required :
1 . these studies shall be performed for any medicinal product whose expected clinical use is for a prolonged period of a patient 's life , either continuously or repeatedly in an intermittent manner .
2 . these studies are recommended for some medicinal products if there is concern about their carcinogenic potential , e.g. from product of the same class or similar structure , or from evidence in repeated dose toxicity studies .
3 . studies with unequivocally geno-toxic compounds are not needed , as they are presumed to be trans-species carcinogens , implying a hazard to humans . if such a medicinal product is intended to be administered chronically to humans a chronic study may be necessary to detect early tumorigenic effects .
e ) reproductive and developmental toxicity
investigation of possible impairment of male or female reproductive function as well as harmful effects on progeny shall be performed by appropriate tests .
these tests comprise studies of effect on adult male or female reproductive function , studies of the toxic and teratogenic effects at all stages of development from conception to sexual maturity as well as latent effects , when the medicinal product under investigation has been administered to the female during pregnancy .
omission of these tests must be adequately justified .
depending on the indicated use of the medicinal product , additional studies addressing development when administering the medicinal product of the offspring may be warranted .
embryo / foetal toxicity studies shall normally be conducted on two mammalian species , one of which shall be other than a rodent . peri- and postnatal studies shall be conducted in at least one species . if the metabolism of a medicinal product in particular species is known to be similar to that in man , it is desirable to include this species . it is also desirable that one of the species is the same as in the repeated dose toxicity studies .
the state of scientific knowledge at the time when the application is lodged shall be taken into account when determining the study design .
f ) local tolerance
the purpose of local tolerance studies is to ascertain whether medicinal products ( both active substances and excipients ) are tolerated at sites in the body , which may come into contact with the medicinal product as a result of its administration in clinical use . the testing strategy shall be such that any mechanical effects of administration or purely physico-chemical actions of the product can be distinguished from toxicological or pharmaco-dynamic ones .
local tolerance testing shall be conducted with the preparation being developed for human use , using the vehicle and / or excipients in treating the control group ( s ) . positive controls / reference substances shall be included where necessary .
the design of local tolerance tests ( choice of species , duration , frequency and route of administration , doses ) will depend upon the problem to be investigated and the proposed conditions of administration in clinical use . reversibility of local lesions shall be performed where relevant .
studies in animals can be substituted by validated in vitro tests provided that the test results are of comparable quality and usefulness for the purpose of safety evaluation .
for chemicals applied to the skin ( e.g. dermal , rectal , vaginal ) the sensitising potential shall be evaluated in at least one of the test systems currently available ( the guinea pig assay or the local lymph node assay ) .

part ii
specific marketing authorisation dossiers and requirements
some medicinal products present specific features which are such that all the requirements of the marketing authorisation application dossier as laid down in part i of this annex need to be adapted . to take account of these particular situations , an appropriate and adapted presentation of the dossier shall be followed by applicants .
1 . well-established medicinal use
for medicinal products the active substance ( s ) of which has / have a " well-established medicinal use " as referred to article 10 ( 1 ) ( a ) ( ii ) , with recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of safety , the following specific rules shall apply .
the applicant shall submit modules 1 , 2 and 3 as described in part i of this annex .
for modules 4 and 5 , a detailed scientific bibliography shall address non-clinical and clinical characteristics .
the following specific rules shall apply in order to demonstrate the well-established medicinal use :
a ) factors which have to be taken into account in order to establish a well-established medicinal use of constituents of medicinal products are :
- the time over which a substance has been used ,
- quantitative aspects of the use of the substance ,
- the degree of scientific interest in the use of the substance ( reflected in the published scientific literature ) and
- the coherence of scientific assessments .
therefore different periods of time may be necessary for establishing well-established use of different substances . in any case , however , the period of time required for establishing a well established medicinal use of a constituent of a medicinal product must not be less than one decade from the first systematic and documented use of that substance as a medicinal product in the community .
c ) particular attention must be paid to any missing information and justification must be given why demonstration of an acceptable level of safety and / or efficacy can be supported although some studies are lacking .
d ) the non-clinical and / or clinical overviews must explain the relevance of any data submitted which concern a product different from the product intended for marketing . a judgement must be made whether the product studied can be considered as similar to the product , for which application for a marketing authorisation has been made in spite of the existing differences .
e ) post-marketing experience with other products containing the same constituents is of particular importance and applicants should put a special emphasis on this issue .
2 . essentially similar medicinal products
a ) applications based upon article 10 ( 1 ) ( a ) ( i ) ( essentially similar products ) shall contain the data described in modules 1 , 2 and 3 of part i of this annex provided the applicant has been granted the consent of the holder of the original marketing authorisation to cross refer to the content of his modules 4 and 5 .
b ) applications based upon article 10 ( 1 ) ( a ) ( iii ) ( essentially similar products i.e. generics ) shall contain the data described in modules 1 , 2 and 3 of part i of this annex together with data showing bio-availability and bio-equivalence with the original medicinal product provided the latter is not a biological medicinal product ( see part ii , 4 similar biological medicinal products ) .
for these products the non-clinical / clinical overviews / summaries shall particularly focus on the following elements :
- the grounds for claiming essential similarity ;
- a summary of impurities present in batches of the active substance ( s ) as well as those of the finished medicinal product ( and where relevant decomposition products arising during storage ) as proposed for use in the product to be marketed together with an evaluation of these impurities ;
- an evaluation of the bio-equivalence studies or a justification why studies were not performed with respect to the guideline on " investigation of bio-availability and bio-equivalence " ;
- an update of published literature relevant to the substance and the present application . it may be acceptable for articles in " peer review " journals to be annotated for this purpose ;
- every claim in the summary of product characteristics not known from or inferred from the properties of the medicinal product and / or its therapeutic group should be discussed in the non clinical / clinical overviews / summaries and substantiated by published literature and / or additional studies .
- if applicable , additional data in order to demonstrate evidence on the equivalence of safety and efficacy properties of different salts , esters or derivatives of an authorised active substance should be provided by the applicant when he claims essential similarity .
3 . additional data required in specific situations
where the active substance of an essentially similar medicinal product contains the same therapeutic moiety as the original authorised product associated with a different salt / ester complex / derivative evidence that there is no change in the pharmaco-kinetics of the moiety , pharmaco-dynamics and / or in toxicity which could change the safety / efficacy profile shall be demonstrated . should this not be the case , this association shall be considered as a new active substance .
where a medicinal product is intended for a different therapeutic use or presented in a different pharmaceutical form or to be administered by different routes or in different doses or with a different posology , the results of appropriate toxicological and pharmacological tests and / or of clinical trials shall be provided .
4 . similar biological medicinal products
the provisions of article 10 ( 1 ) ( a ) ( iii ) may not be sufficient in the case of biological medicinal products . if the information required in the case of essentially similar products ( generics ) does not permit the demonstration of the similar nature of two biological medicinal products , additional data , in particular , the toxicological and clinical profile shall be provided .
when a biological medicinal product as defined in part i , paragraph 3.2 of this annex , which refers to an original medicinal product having been granted a marketing authorisation in the community , is submitted for a marketing authorisation by an independent applicant after the expiry of data protection period , the following approach shall be applied .
- information to be supplied shall not be limited to modules 1 , 2 and 3 ( pharmaceutical , chemical and biological data ) , supplemented with bio-equivalence and bio-availability data . the type and amount of additional data ( i.e. toxicological and other non-clinical and appropriate clinical data ) shall be determined on a case by case basis in accordance with relevant scientific guidelines .
- due to the diversity of biological medicinal products , the need for identified studies foreseen in modules 4 and 5 , shall be required by the competent authority , taking into account the specific characteristic of each individual medicinal product .
the general principles to be applied are addressed in a guideline taking into account the characteristics of the concerned biological medicinal product published by the agency . in case the originally authorised medicinal product has more than one indication , the efficacy and safety of the medicinal product claimed to be similar has to be justified or , if necessary , demonstrated separately for each of the claimed indications .
5 . fixed combination medicinal products
applications based upon article 10 ( 1 ) ( b ) shall relate to new medicinal products made of at least two active substances not previously authorised as a fixed combination medicinal product .
for those applications a full dossier ( modules 1 to 5 ) shall be provided for the fixed combination medicinal product . where applicable , information regarding the manufacturing sites and the adventitious agents , safety evaluation shall be provided .
6 . documentation for applications in exceptional circumstances
when , as provided for in article 22 , the applicant can show that he is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use , because :
- the indications for which the product in question is intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence , or
- in the present state of scientific knowledge , comprehensive information cannot be provided , or
- it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect such information ,
marketing authorisation may be granted subject to certain specific obligations .
- the applicant shall complete an identified programme of studies within a time period specified by the competent authority , the results of which shall form the basis of a reassessment of the benefit / risk profile ,
