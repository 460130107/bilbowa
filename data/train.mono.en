protocol to the european agreement on the exchange of blood-grouping reagents
general provisions
1 . specificity
a blood-grouping ( 1 ) reagent must react with all blood samples tested which contain the antigen homologous to the antibody or other substance mentioned on the label .
when a reagent is used according to the technique recommended by the producer there must be no evidence of any of the following factors or phenomena : ( a ) haemolytic properties ;
( b ) antibodies or other substances besides those mentioned on the label ;
( c ) bacterial products liable to cause false positive or false negative reactions ;
( d ) pseudo-agglutination through the formation of rouleaux ;
( e ) prozone phenomena .
2 . potency
titre is measured by making successive two-fold dilutions of the reagent under study in an appropriate medium . to each dilution is added an equal volume of a suspension of red corpuscles . the titre is the reciprocal of the figure representing the highest serum dilution in which a reaction occurs , the dilution being calculated without the inclusion of the volume of the corpuscular suspension in the total volume .
in the case of anti-a , anti-b and other reagents intended for use on slides , avidity is expressed by means of the time required for agglutination on a slide .
3 . international standards and international units
the potency of blood-grouping reagents for which international standard preparations exist ( at present anti-a and anti-b and incomplete anti-d ) can be expressed in international units ( see bull , wld . hlth . org . 1954 , 10 , 937 , 941-1950 , 3 , 301 ) on the basis of the titration of the unknown reagent in comparison with the international standard , or a national sub-standard .
the international standard preparations of blood-grouping sera are dispensed in ampoules containing dried human serum . when reconstituted to the volume of 1 ml , the anti-a and anti-b sera contain by definition 256 international units per ml . they can be obtained free of charge , from the international laboratory for biological standards of who , statens seruminstitut , copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative titration of the international standard anti-a serum ( s ) and an " unknown " anti-a reagent ( u ) against a1 red corpuscles and a2b red corpuscles . > pic file = " t0045086 " >
4 . stability and expiry date
each reagent , when kept under the conditions of storage recommended by the manufacturer , should retain the requisite properties for at least one year .
the expiry date of a reagent in the liquid form as given on the label shall be not more than one year from the date of the last satisfactory potency test . the expiry date can be extended for further periods of one year by repetition of potency tests .
the expiry date of reagents in the dried form as given on the label shall be in accordance with evidence obtained from experiments on stability and shall be approved by the national control authorities .
5 . preservation
blood-grouping reagents may be preserved in the liquid or dried state . dried reagents shall be kept in an atmosphere of an inert gas or in vacuo , in the glass container in which they were dried and which shall be closed so as to exclude moisture . a dried reagent must not lose more than 0,5 % of its weight when tested by further drying over phosphorus pentoxide at a pressure not exceeding 0,02 mm of mercury for 24 hours .
reagents shall be prepared with aseptic precautions and shall be free from bacterial contamination . in order to prevent bacterial growth the competent national authority may decide that an antiseptic and / or antibiotic shall be added to the reagent ( or to any solvent issued with dried reagents ) , provided that , in the presence of the added substance , the reagent still fulfils the requirements for specificity and potency .
blood-grouping sera of human origin must contain at least 2,5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of liquid or reconstituted serum .
reagents whether in the liquid state or after reconstitution should be transparent and should not contain any sediment , gel or visible particles .
6 . coloration
blood-grouping reagents for international exchanges should preferably not be artificially coloured at least until an international agreement is reached on a uniform system . any added colouring matter must not interfere with the specific reaction .
7 . dispensing and volume
blood-grouping reagents shall be dispensed in such a way and in such volumes that the reagent in one container is sufficient for the performance of tests with positive and negative control corpuscles in addition to the performance of tests with the unknown corpuscles . the volume in one container shall be such that the contents can if necessary be used for the performance of the appropriate tests for potency described in this protocol .
8 . records and samples
written records shall be kept by the producing laboratory of all steps in the production and control of blood-grouping reagents . adequate samples of all reagents issued shall be retained by the laboratory until it can be reasonably assumed that the batch is no longer in use .
9 . classification of reagents
reagents used for blood-grouping may contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin , of which some constitute the active principle and others are adjuvants for enhancing the activity or maintaining the stability of the reagent .
for technical reasons these reagents have been divided into three categories according to the origin of their active principle . this does not mean that reagents of human origin contain exclusively substances of human origin or that animal or vegetable reagents cannot contain substances of human origin .
10 . labels , leaflets and certificates
a label printed in english and french , in black on white paper , shall be affixed to each final container and shall contain the following information : 1 . name and address of producer ;
2 . name of the reagent as it appears in the heading of the relevant specification ;
3 . name and amount of antiseptic and / or antibiotic , if present , or indication of absence ;

protocol to the agreement on the importation of educational , scientific and cultural materials
council decision of 8 may 1979 on the conclusion of the protocol to the agreement on the importation of educational , scientific and cultural materials ( 79 / 505 / eec )
the council of the european communities , having regard to the treaty establishing the european economic community , having regard to the recommendation from the commission ,
whereas the agreement on the importation of educational , scientific and cultural materials , known as the florence agreement , drawn up on the initiative of unesco , is intended to facilitate the free flow of books , publications and educational , scientific and cultural materials ; whereas for this purpose the agreement includes inter alia provision for the non-application of customs duties on the importation of such articles ;
whereas on 26 november 1976 the 19th general conference of unesco adopted a protocol to the florence agreement in order to extend relief from customs duties to a number of articles hitherto excluded from such relief ; whereas this protocol , although constituting an act complementing the agreement , should nevertheless be considered a separate instrument ;
whereas , subject to recourse to the possibilities afforded by paragraph 16 ( a ) of the protocol , the provisions of the protocol are in conformity with the aims of the european economic community ; whereas it is therefore desirable to conclude this protocol and at the same time make the declarations referred to in paragraph 16 ( a ) . has decided as follows :
1 . the protocol of 26 november 1976 to the agreement on the importation of educational , scientific and cultural materials is hereby approved on behalf of the european economic community .
the text of the protocol is annexed to this decision . 2 . when the protocol is signed it shall be declared that the community : - shall not be bound by parts ii and iv ,

article 1
a levy shall be applied to exports of icelandic fish products specified in this law .
fish caught by fishing vessels registered in iceland shall be considered as icelandic products even if such fish is caught outside icelandic fishing limits and not processed ashore .

2 . a levy of 3 % of the f.o.b. value shall be applied to exports of whole frozen fish , frozen fish waste , frozen norway lobster , frozen shrimp , frozen capelin , capelin meal , capelin oil and hydrogenated oils and fats from fish or marine mammals .

500 icelandic crowns per 100 kg of contents may be deducted from the f.o.b. value of salted herring and salted lumpfish roes to cover packing costs .
5 . a levy of 7 % of the f.o.b. value shall be applied to exports of fresh and chilled fish .
the ministry of fisheries may , however , decide that they levy on fresh or chilled herring shall be equal to that which would have been applicable had the herring been processed in iceland by the same method as it to be used abroad ( see points 4 and 6 of this article ) .

where icelandic vessels sell , in foreign ports , fresh or processed fish products caught by their own or other vessels and subject to this levy , the said levy shall be applied on the gross value of such sales , less customs duties and other unloading and sales charges , in accordance with rules issued by the ministry of fisheries .
article 3
the treasury shall collect the export levy in accordance with the provisions of article 2 , and the receipts shall be distributed as follows : > pic file = " t0010751 " >
payment of the insurance premiums for fishing vessels referred to in item 1 may be subject to the condition that the insurance company concerned be a member of the underwriters ' reinsurance union and be required to apply certain rules concerning calculation of premium rates , insurance terms and hull values .
whalers may be exempted from these conditions and are then entitled to reimbursement of their contribution to the fishing vessels ' insurance fund instead of the insurance premiums .
article 4
the levy provided for in article 2 , points 2 , 3 and 4 , shall be applied to the selling price of the products , including packing , f.o.b. vessel in the first port of landing . the value of products sold c.i.f. or under other terms shall be adjusted to the f.o.b. value in accordance with rules issued by the ministry of trade .
where unsold products are exported the export levy provided for in article 2 , points 2 , 3 and 4 , shall be calculated on the basis of the minimum export price stipulated in the export licence .
if the exporter supplies proof , within 6 months of the date shown on the bill of lading , that the price of an unsold fish product , as determined by the competent authority , is higher than the actual selling price , the ministry of finance shall refund the difference , subject to confirmation by the ministry of trade that sale at the lower price has been approved .

article 7
the ship and its cargo shall constitute surety for payment of the export levy .

monsieur j. m. bischoff ,
commission internationale de l 'état civil ,
faculté du droit et des sciences politiques ,
f-67084 strasbourg .
sirs ,
following talks between representatives of our two bodies on a desirable form of mutual cooperation , i wish to propose the following arrangements :
1 . the international commission on civil status ( hereinafter called 'the ciec ' ) will notify the commission of the european communities ( hereinafter called 'the cec ' ) of all matters included on the agenda of meetings of its general assembly .
the cec may make known to the ciec its potential interest in one or more of those matters and , in that event , will render assistance in the form of opinions or information .
2 . the cec will inform the ciec of all matters referred to it relating to civil status , personal and family law and the determination of nationality .
it will afford the ciec an opportunity to concern itself with such matters . the ciec will study them and inform the cec of the results of its work . if the findings are unfavourable , the cec may itself take the matters in hand and the ciec will render assistance in the form of opinions or technical data .
3 . the cec may recommend the member states of the european communities to sign and ratify conventions drawn up by the ciec on subjects submitted to it by the cec , or to accede to such conventions .
the ciec may recommend the cec to advise the member states of the european communities to sign and ratify any other convention adopted by the ciec or to accede thereto .
4 . the ciec may recommend its members to sign and ratify conventions drawn up by the european communities relating to subjects in respect of which the ciec has rendered assistance , or to accede thereto .
5 . the cec will be invited to send representatives to general meetings of the ciec dealing with questions of interest to it .
6 . the ciec will be invited to send representatives to meetings of committees convened by the cec dealing with questions of interest to it .
i should be grateful if you would inform me whether , as i hope , the above proposals can serve as a basis for our future cooperation . this letter and your letter of acceptance will thus constitute a cooperation agreement between the european economic community and the international commission on civil status . if your reply is in the affirmative , the agreement will enter into force immediately .
for the commission

whereas the kingdom of belgium , the kingdom of denmark , the federal republic of germany , ireland , the italian republic , the grand duchy of luxembourg and the kingdom of the netherlands ( hereinafter referred to as " the states " ) are signatories of the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons ( hereinafter referred to as " the treaty " ) opened for signature at london , moscow and washington on 1 july 1968 and which entered into force on 5 march 1970 ;
recalling that pursuant to article iv ( 1 ) of the treaty nothing in the treaty shall be interpreted as affecting the inalienable right of all the parties to the treaty to develop research , production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and in conformity with articles i and ii of the treaty ;
recalling that according to article iv ( 2 ) of the treaty all the parties to the treaty undertake to facilitate , and have the right to participate in , the fullest possible exchange of equipment , materials and scientific and technological information for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy ;
recalling further that under the terms of the same paragraph the parties to the treaty in a position to do so shall also cooperate in contributing alone or together with other states or international organizations to the further development of the applications of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes , especially in the territories of non-nuclear-weapon states party to the treaty ;
whereas article iii ( 4 ) provides that non-nuclear-weapon states party to the treaty shall conclude agreements with the agency to meet the requirements of the said article either individually or together with other states in accordance with the statute ;
whereas the states are members of the european atomic energy community ( euratom ) ( hereinafter referred to as " the community " ) and have assigned to institutions common to the european communities regulatory , executive and judicial powers which these institutions exercise in their own right in those areas for which they are competent and which may take effect directly within the legal systems of the member states ;
whereas these safeguards include notification to the community of the basic technical characteristics of nuclear facilities , maintenance and submission of operating records to permit nuclear materials accounting for the community as a whole , inspections by officials of the community , and a system of sanctions ;

whereas the agency , in the light of its statutory responsibilities and its relationship to the general assembly and the security council of the united nations , has the responsibility to assure the international community that effective safeguards are being applied under the treaty ;
noting that the states , which were members of the community when they signed the treaty , made it known on that occasion that safeguards provided for in article iii ( 1 ) of the treaty would have to be set out in a verification agreement between the community , the states and the agency and defined in such a way that the rights and obligations of the states and the community would not be affected ;
whereas the board of governors of the agency ( hereinafter referred to as " the board " ) has approved a comprehensive set of model provisions for the structure and content of agreements between the agency and states required in connection with the treaty to be used as the basis for negotiating safeguards agreements between the agency and non-nuclear-weapon states party to the treaty ;
whereas the agency is authorized under article iii ( a ) ( 5 ) of the statute , to apply safeguards , at the request of the parties , to any bilateral or multilateral arrangement , or at the request of a state , to any of that state 's activities in the field of atomic energy ;
whereas it is the desire of the agency , the community and the states to avoid unnecessary duplication of safeguards activities ;

annex concerning customs warehouses introduction
it is in the nature of international trade practice that in a great many cases it is not known at the time of importation how imported goods will finally be disposed of . this means that the importers are obliged to store the goods for more or less long periods .
where it is intended to re-export the goods , it is in the importer 's interest to place them under a customs procedure which obviates the need to pay import duties and taxes .
when goods are intended for outright importation , it is again in the importer 's interest to be able to delay payment of the import duties and taxes until the goods are actually taken into home use .
in order to make these facilities available to importers , most countries have provided in their national legislations for the customs warehousing procedure .
however , imported goods are not the only goods which may qualify for customs warehousing .
for example , some countries allow goods that are liable to , or have borne , internal duties and taxes ( whether of national origin or previously imported against payment of import duties and taxes ) to be stored in customs warehouses in order that they may qualify for exemption from , or repayment of , such internal duties and taxes .
similarly , the deposit in a customs warehouse of goods that have previously been dealt with under another customs procedure or that may qualify , upon exportation , for repayment of import duties and taxes , makes it possible for the customs authorities to grant discharge of such other customs procedure or to repay the import duties and taxes , as the case may be , before the goods are actually re-exported .
the provisions of this annex do not apply to :
- the storage of goods in temporary store ( locked premises and enclosed or unenclosed spaces approved by the customs , in which goods may be stored pending clearance ) ;
- the storage of goods in free ports and free zones ;
- the processing or manufacturing , under customs supervision , of goods conditionally relieved from import duties and taxes in premises approved by the customs ( inward processing warehouses ) .
definitions

( a ) the term " customs warehousing procedure " means the customs procedure under which imported goods are stored under customs control in a designated place ( a customs warehouse ) without payment of import duties and taxes ;
( b ) the term " import duties and taxes " means customs duties and all other duties , taxes , fees or other charges which are collected on or in connection with the importation of goods , but not including fees and charges which are limited in amount to the approximate cost of services rendered ;
( c ) the term " customs control " means measures applied to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations which the customs are responsible for enforcing ;
( d ) the term " security " means that which ensures , to the satisfaction of the customs , that an obligation to the customs will be fulfilled . security is described as " general " when it ensures that the obligations arising from several operations will be fulfilled ;
( e ) the term " person " means both natural and legal persons , unless the context otherwise requires .

annexe concernant les entrepÔts de douane
introduction
en raison des pratiques du commerce international , la destination finale des marchandises importées n 'est pas connue au moment de l 'importation dans un nombre élevé de cas , ce qui oblige les importateurs à les stocker pendant des délais plus ou moins longs .
s 'il s 'agit de marchandises destinées à être réexportées , l 'importateur a intérêt à les placer sous un régime douanier qui permet d 'éviter le paiement des droits et taxes à l 'importation .
quant aux marchandises qui sont destinées à l 'importation définitive , il est également de l 'intérêt de l 'importateur de pouvoir retarder le paiement des droits et taxes à l 'importation jusqu 'au moment où ces marchandises seront effectivement mises à la consommation .
pour accorder ces facilités aux importateurs , les États ont généralement prévu le régime de l 'entrepôt de douane dans leur législation nationale .
les marchandises importées ne sont cependant pas les seules qui soient admissibles en entrepôt de douane .
c 'est ainsi que certains États permettent que les marchandises d 'origine nationale ou nationalisées , qui sont passibles de droits ou de taxes internes , ou qui les ont supportés , soient mises en entrepôt de douane afin d 'obtenir l 'exonération ou le remboursement de ces droits et taxes .
de même , la mise en entrepôt de douane de marchandises auxquelles a déjà été appliqué un autre régime douanier ou qui sont susceptibles de bénéficier , lors de leur exportation , d 'un remboursement des droits et taxes à l 'importation , permet aux autorités douanières d 'accorder , selon le cas , l 'apurement de cet autre régime douanier ou le remboursement des droits et taxes à l 'importation , sans attendre la réexportation effective des marchandises .
les dispositions de la présente annexe ne s 'appliquent pas :
- au stockage des marchandises en dépôt temporaire ( locaux fermés et emplacements , clôturés ou non , agréés par la douane , où les marchandises sont stockées en attendant leur dédouanement ) ;
- au stockage des marchandises dans des ports francs et des zones franches ;
- à l 'ouvraison ou à la transformation , sous contrôle de la douane , en suspension des droits et taxes à l 'importation , de marchandises dans des endroits agréés par elle ( entrepôts pour perfectionnement actif ) .
dÉfinitions
pour l 'application de la présente annexe , on entend :
a ) par " régime de l 'entrepôt de douane " : le régime douanier en application duquel les marchandises importées sont stockées sous contrôle de la douane dans un lieu désigné à cet effet ( entrepôt de douane ) sans paiement des droits et taxes à l 'importation ;
b ) par " droits et taxes à l 'importation " : les droits de douane et tous autres droits , taxes et redevances ou impositions diverses qui sont perçus à l 'importation ou à l 'occasion de l 'importation des marchandises , à l 'exception des redevances et impositions dont le montant est limité au coût approximatif des services rendus ;
c ) par " contrôle de la douane " : l 'ensemble des mesures prises en vue d 'assurer l 'observation des lois et règlements que la douane est chargée d 'appliquer ;
d ) par " garantie " : ce qui assure , à la satisfaction de la douane , l 'exécution d 'une obligation envers celle-ci . la garantie est dite " globale " lorsqu 'elle assure l 'exécution des obligations résultant de plusieurs opérations ;
e ) par " personne " : aussi bien une personne physique qu 'une personne morale , à moins que le contexte n 'en dispose autrement .
